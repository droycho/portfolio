        <h4><strong>A bit about me...</strong></h4>
        <p>I graduated from Oregon State University in 2012 with a BA in New Media Communications. This field of study is similar to traditional media (such as print, broadcast radio, and television), except for the fact that it is geared for online presentation and includes "new media" aspects, such as social media, blogging, podcasts, etc. While in college, my primary focus/job was mainly field reporting for college sports and preparing my bits for online production rather than television. However, I spent more time in front of the camera rather than behind a computer. As a result, most of my skills from college were infact in traditional media, rather than the new. Great. How do I stay relevant? Learn how to code, of course! Learning how to program and maintain my own sites/apps/databases allow me to function in every aspect of media production. This includes pre-, field-, and post-production, as well as build the site it will be hosted on, create a database to store all of our video/archives (using Firebase or SQL), and update and maintain the site. This allowed me to gain a firm understanding of creating my own content, storing that content securely, and displaying relevant content based on user preferences. Considering the fact that my childhood/teenage passions were planning, shooting, editing, and uploading skateboard and snowboard videos, as well as making music videos with my high school punk band, this is my dream career. Thank you very much for taking the time to read this far. Since you're already here, I invite you to take a look at my Github repositories, or check out a few of my favorite projects below.
